R9 390 series poor performance and/or instability

If you experience issues [5] with a AMD R9 390 series graphics card, set radeon.cik_support=0 radeon.si_support=0 amdgpu.cik_support=1 amdgpu.si_support=1 amdgpu.dc=1 as kernel parameters to force the use of amdgpu driver instead of radeon.

If it still does not work, try disabling DPM, by setting the kernel parameters to: radeon.cik_support=0 radeon.si_support=0 amdgpu.cik_support=1 amdgpu.si_support=1 



Issues with power management / dynamic re-activation of a discrete amdgpu graphics card

If you encounter issues similar to [9], you can workaround the issue by setting the kernel parameter amdgpu.runpm=0, which prevents the dGPU from being powered down dynamically at runtime.
